Mac/Linux: /etc/hosts

Step 2: Open with a text editor (admin privileges may be needed).

127.0.0.1    [IP_ADDRESS]

Replace [IP_ADDRESS] with the target IP.

Step 4: Save and restart Brave.

3. Installing an Extension

Use browser extensions to block specific IP addresses or domains.

Step 1: Open Brave and go to the Chrome Web Store.
Step 2: Search for IP blocking extensions like “Block Site” or “uBlock Origin.”
Step 3: Install the extension and set up to block desired IPs.

4. Configuring a Firewall
For robust protection, use a firewall to block IPs at the system level.
